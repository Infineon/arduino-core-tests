/**
 * @brief This test focuses on the verification the TX functionality of the UART
 * communication. 
 * 
 * @details This test is paired with the "test_uart_rx.cpp"s test, which
 * running on a second board will implement RX functionality.
 * 
 * Ultimately, the instance also wait for a reply back from the other other to 
 * verify the full duplex capability of the UART communication.
 * 
 * An additional pin is used to synchronize the start of the test. The other 
 * end wait for rising edge on the pin to start running the test.
 * 
 * The following steps are performed:
 * - notify the other end that the test will start
 * - begin the UART communication
 * - write one byte
 * - write multiple bytes
 * - print in a loop
 * - print a end of line
 * - check the availableForWrite
 * - write a longer string than the writable buffer
 * - read the reply back from the other end
 * - end the UART communication
 * 
 * This test is meant as a happy path verification of the API functions 
 * of the UART class TX mode. 
 * 
 * Exception and corner/edge cases are not covered in this test. 
 * 
 * @note This test must be run AFTER the "test_uart_rx.cpp" test.
