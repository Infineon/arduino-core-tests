/** 
 * @name    test_spi_connected2_masterpingpong.cpp
 *
 * @brief   This test is used to verify the functionality of the SPI transfer functions.
 *          2 boards are needed with SPI pins of master board connected to SPI pins of slave board.
 *          Also a sync pin is used to synchronize the transfer between master and slave.
 * 
 * @note    These tests are expected to be executed after slave tests are executed.
 *          Make sure no SPI data is being transferred before executing these tests which
 *          may interfere with the test results.
